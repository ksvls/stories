## The 2020 Online School Experience
After 2019, Entering 8.4 class was a bit of a problem. I don't know people's behavior, face, only their names and whatsapp number. Although I know some in 8.4 and has met them.

### Weeks before chaos
Everything is fine at this time, I quickly adapted to online school system.
Doing every assigments that I need to.

### Start of the chaos
When checking back how I was peforming on the previous daily exam. I was surprised "how can this answer can be wrong?", because thats the right answer everywhere else (even in the subject matter it self). Making me lazy because of that, like "Is this *intentional*? or what?".

### The chaos it self
Day by day I was not doing my assigment. Why, you may ask? please read previous section. Although the easier one I do. Also some announcement are announced a day before the event itself which is annoying. Also why some assigment are not marked as assigment so that I need to send the answer using Whatsapp? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

### Months before 2021 start

At this time I was starting to do all of my undone assigment from easier one to hardest. And most of my assigment are done now, maybe except the *long subject matter that needs to be written*. 


## Summary
### What happen and why
Lazyness appear after a few weeks into previous year of online school. Because there is a problem that frustrate me.

### What I learn
- Doing things later make things worse. 
- Complaining about things don't make it better.

### Plan for 2021
Doing every assigment as fast as possible so that bloody hell 2020 experience hopefully never comeback.
